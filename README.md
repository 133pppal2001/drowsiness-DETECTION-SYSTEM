## Motivation: 
According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, every year about 100,000 police-reported crashes involve drowsy driving. These crashes result in more than 1,550 fatalities and 71,000 injuries. The real number may be much higher, however, as it is difficult to determine whether a driver was drowsy at the time of a crash. So, we tried to build a system, that detects whether a person is drowsy and alert him. 
## Running the system: 

### Step 1: 
Clone the repository into your system by: 
```bash 
git clone https://github.com/fear-the-lord/Drowsiness-Detection.git
```
Or directly download the zip.

### Step 2: 
Download the file <b>shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat</b><a href = "https://drive.google.com/file/d/14weZIclFncz8BMOmrkLp9PadLIccbSBa/view?usp=sharing"> here.</a> Make sure you download it in the same folder. 

### Step 3: 
Install all the system requirments by:
```bash 
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 4: 
After the system has been setup. Run the command: 
```bash 
python app1.py
```

### Step 5: 
Open your browser and in the search bar type: 
<b>localhost:8000</b> as this port is mostly used by flask. 
In case, this port is not available in your system, flask will try to use another port. The port number will be displayed in the command prompt.
So, type in the same port number in that case as: 
<b>localhost:<port_number></b>.
  
After all these steps have been completed successfully, you will see a web page opening up in the browser. Now you are free to explore the system.

## Working Details: 

The basic thing about drowsiness detection is pretty simple. We first detect a face using dlib's frontal face detector. Once the face is detected , we try to detect the facial landmarks in the face using the dlib's landmark predictor. Ofcourse, we don't need all the landmarks, here we need to extract only the eye and the mouth region. 

Now, after extraxting the landmarks we calculate the <b>Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR)</b> as: 

```python 
def eye_aspect_ratio(eye):
	# Vertical eye landmarks
	A = dist.euclidean(eye[1], eye[5])
	B = dist.euclidean(eye[2], eye[4])
	# Horizontal eye landmarks 
	C = dist.euclidean(eye[0], eye[3])

	# The EAR Equation 
	EAR = (A + B) / (2.0 * C)
	return EAR
```
The eye region is marked my 6 coordinates. These coordinates can be used to find whether the eye is open or closed if the value of EAR is checked with a certain threshold value.
